;;; Commentary:

;; Support for replacing S-expressions in files to save variables
;; similar to how easy Customize does it.  In fact most of the code
;; is taken from `cus-edit.el' and is just generalized a bit for use
;; outside Customize.

;; A variable's value can be saved like this:
;;
;;   (save-sexp-save "/some/file.el" 'save-sexp-save-setq-1
;;                   'some-variable 'pp-to-string)

;; But since this is the usecase for which this library was created a
;; shortcut exists (which is also an interactive command):
;;
;;   (save-sexp-save-setq "/some/file.el" 'some-variable)

;; If on the other hand you want to use another form this gets you
;; started:
;;
;;   (save-sexp-save "/some/file.el"
;;                   (lambda (var pp)
;;                     (save-sexp-default-save 'defcustom var pp 2))
;;                   'some-variable 'pp-to-string)

;;; Code:

(defun save-sexp-save-setq (file variable)
  "Save the current value of VARIABLE in FILE using a `setq' form.
The value of VARIABLE is pretty-printed using function `pp-to-string'."
  (interactive (list (read-variable "Save variable: ")
                     (read-file-name "in file: ")))
  (save-sexp-save file 'save-sexp-save-setq-1 variable 'pp-to-string))

(defun save-sexp-save (file save &rest args)
  "Save something specified by ARGS in FILE using SAVE.

This function only prepares a buffer to edit FILE and then calls
function SAVE with ARGS arguments.  That function is responsible
for actually saving the thing specified by ARGS after removing
existing forms which set the same thing.

Function `save-sexp-delete' can be used in SAVE to remove
existing forms.

Function `save-sexp-indent' can be used in SAVE to indent the
value part of the inserted value.

In many cases instead of using the above functions in SAVE
`save-sexp-default-save' can be used.

See function `save-sexp-save-setq-1' for a function that uses
`save-sexp-default-save' and can be used as SAVE."
